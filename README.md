# RoundlessDark KDE window decorations

KDE Aurorae window decorations with no roundness, grey shadow for better discerning overlapping windows, and  blurred titlebar.

## No rounding

Main reason I created this - all pointy corners, no rounded corner in sight.

## Light border

The second main reason I created these decorations. I like my KDE windows borderless (`Settings > Color and Themes > Window Decorations`, top drop-down menu), but the decorations I tried either did not have any visual separation between borderless windows, or they did have a separation I didn't like. Mine is practically a less than 2px shadow based on the 50% lightness grey, which should be more or less half way between white and black, so it should be visible on most color schemes. Maybe my shadow is a bit light, though. We'll see.

## Slight blur on titlebar

Well, it looks kinda cool, but it is subtle enough to not make me want to read the text under the titlebar.

## Note

You probably already know this, but I'll say it anyway: while the screenshot below features all the available buttons, one can choose what buttons and in what order they appear, from `Settings > Color and Themes > Window Decorations`, the `Configure Titlebar Buttons` top button.
