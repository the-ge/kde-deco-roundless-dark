# RoundlessDark KDE window decorations

KDE Aurorae window decorations with no roundness, grey shadow for better discerning overlapping windows, and  blurred titlebar.

## No rounding

All pointy corners, no rounded corner in sight.

## Light border

Main reason I created these decorations. I like my KDE windows borderless (`Settings > Color and Themes > Window Decorations`, top drop-down menu), but the decorations I tried either did not have any visual separation between borderless windows, or they did have a separation I didn't like. Mine is practically a less than 2px shadow based on the 50% lightness grey, which should be more or less half way between white and black, so it should be visible on most color schemes. Maybe my shadow is a bit light, though. We'll see.

## Slight blur on titlebar

No reason other that it looks kinda cool.
